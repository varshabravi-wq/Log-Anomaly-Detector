# 🛡️ Enterprise Production Log Anomaly Radar & Alerting System

An end-to-end, memory-optimized streaming telemetry dashboard designed to ingest production server transaction logs, run live feature extraction, and leverage an unsupervised **Isolation Forest** machine learning algorithm to intercept and isolate security anomalies in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Key Architectural Features
* **Streaming Architecture:** Uses lazy chunk-loading arrays via Pandas to ingest mass raw transactional inputs row-by-row with minimal overhead, simulating a true streaming telemetry line.
* **Defensive Engineering Block:** Outfitted with robust `try-except` execution checkpoints to catch, log, and skip malformed or corrupt numerical payloads without interrupting the live visualization stream.
* **Persistent Session State Memory:** Leverages custom state tokens to prevent data volatility, ensuring metrics, charts, and audit logs remain fully visible on the user interface even after the data stream finishes or halts.
* **Incident Audit Exporter:** Features a one-click dynamic forensic reporting module to package and download captured infrastructure anomalies directly into standard `.csv` spreads for automated incident distribution.

## 🛠️ Technological Infrastructure Stack
* **Frontend UI Framework:** Streamlit (Custom Dark Matrix CSS Styling overrides)
* **Core Analytics Platform:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning Intelligence Core:** Scikit-Learn (Unsupervised Outlier Isolation Model Core)
* **State Compression Serialization:** Joblib
